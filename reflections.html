                Wade Davis's quote, "We are all cut from the same genetic cloth," highlights the idea that despite the vast diversity of human cultures and experiences, we are fundamentally united by our shared genetic heritage. With this thinking, I always get intrigued by the fact that on one side of the story we witness abundance while the other side struggles to have a single meal in a day.
              </p>
              <button class="toggle-btn" type="button" aria-expanded="false">My take on this ▾</button>
              <div class="collapsible" hidden>
                <p>
                  Taking inspiration from the quote "You can't build a peaceful world on an empty stomach," my writeup is on food security. It has three aspects:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Food availability</li>
                  <li>Ability to access food</li>
                  <li>Ability to utilize food</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  There are macro- and micro-dimensions to food security. The ability of people to purchase food is a function of markets for local products and labour, including the costs of labour relative to the costs of food. Micro-issues include a household's capacity to grow its own food, to purchase food, and the health of people as this affects their ability to effectively utilize food.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Climate change seems likely to impact agricultural production for both subsistence and commercial purposes, undermining local availability of food and the ability of people and societies to purchase food. With nearly half of the world's population residing within or near small towns and cities, we must strengthen linkages between rural and urban areas. An example from the North Indian state of Uttar Pradesh shows how expanded electrification and improvements in the road network allowed cold storage and transportation to be introduced, benefiting potato producers, agribusinesses, and urban consumers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is a lot more that can be done. We can leverage our ancient wisdom where the very few "people of earth" still feel they are guardians of mother earth not for personal gains but to preserve it for future generations. It is time for stakeholders to walk the talk and make proactive contributions instead of waiting for others to act.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With this intention, perhaps "Zero Hunger" and "Poverty Reduction" can be accelerated by creating strong linkages between communities and societies on the lines of shared prosperity for all instead of pocketed growth across the world reflecting the divide between the "have" and "have not".
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is time to change the narrative by asking not what the government or country has done for us but what we have done for our mother earth.
                </p>

  <h3>Modernization, Capitalism &amp; Freedom</h3>

  <p class="preview">
    Capitalism is synonymous with private ownership and never-ending greed for profit. Ironically, worldwide, this has been a dominant economic model.
  </p>
  <button class="toggle-btn" type="button" aria-expanded="false">My take on this ▾</button>
  <div class="collapsible" hidden>
    <p>
      Global development, economics, and social structures are shaped by policies and implementation seeing through this prism. The article presents a critique capturing Stiglitz's work on the big ideas that changed the world. It was like time travel for me, visualizing the big picture and zoom-in view around how past decisions have shaped lives today in the name of modernization.
    </p>
    <p>The concerns are many:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Inequality and market failures mean money often flows from poor countries to rich nations.</li>
      <li>Capitalism can spur innovation and economic growth but can also compartmentalize societies and alienate communities.</li>
      <li>The model frequently results in exploitation and marginalization of developing countries through unequal trade and debt dependency.</li>
      <li>Rostow's linear theory of development overlooks the unique historical, cultural, and institutional contexts of different countries.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All these perspectives highlight the complexities and contradictions of capitalism and expose the importance of balancing economic growth with social equity and environmental sustainability. While Rostow’s model has influenced development policies, its Eurocentric assumptions overlook unique contexts, often reinforcing global inequalities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, considering humanity as a collective entity, there is no space for isolated individual prosperity—it is inseparable from shared prosperity for all. As a development sector contributor, I see scope for more collaborative work that begins with good intention across all stakeholders. A holistic approach, rather than a one-dimensional one, is key to unleashing the real potential of our modern world and empowering each other instead of letting humanity down.

  <h3>Doughnut Economic Model</h3>

    <img src="ted.jpeg" alt="Doughnut Economics TED Talk thumbnail">
  </a>

  <p class="preview">
    In this 2018 TED Talk, Oxford economist Kate Raworth challenges the prevailing obsession with GDP growth that has dominated economic thinking since the 1930s, arguing that growth alone has produced rising inequality and ecological crisis.
  </p>
  <button class="toggle-btn" type="button" aria-expanded="false">My take on this ▾</button>
  <div class="collapsible" hidden>
    <p>
      She introduces the now-famous Doughnut Economic Model, which envisions a “safe and just space” framed by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>An inner social foundation ensuring that everyone’s basic needs—such as food, health, education, housing, gender equality, and political voice—are met.</li>
      <li>An outer ecological ceiling defined by nine planetary boundaries, including climate stability, biodiversity, freshwater availability, and chemical pollution, beyond which we risk destabilizing Earth systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Raworth warns against believing in “endless green growth”—the idea that GDP can grow indefinitely while resource use declines.
      Instead, she looks to nature: growth must plateau and mature to allow long-term thriving, not endless expansion.
      She calls for economies designed to be regenerative—restoring natural and social capital—and distributive by design,
      using technologies (renewables, blockchain, open-source systems, social enterprises) to share wealth, knowledge,
      and opportunity more widely across populations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her proposed shift is one from pursuing growth as a goal to cultivating an economy that enables human prosperity
      within planetary limits—a dynamic balance rather than a straight upward curve.
    </p>

    <h4>Reflective Commentary:</h4>
    <p>
      Kate Raworth’s talk is a refreshing and provocative reframing of economic progress—moving from a linear obsession
      with growth to a more holistic and ecological vision of thriving. The doughnut model is powerful because it turns
      abstract concepts into a relatable visual compass: thriving means living within the green ring, not the extremes
      of deprivation or ecological overshoot.
    </p>
    <h4>Key reflections:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The lure of growth remains deeply embedded:</strong> Our financial systems, political incentives, and cultural stories are built around the expectation of ever-rising growth—even when growth fails to deliver well-being equitably. Breaking that structural dependency is a monumental but necessary task. The talk makes this clear without sugarcoating the challenge.</li>
      <li><strong>Real-world relevance and growing adoption:</strong> Cities like Amsterdam and Glasgow are beginning to apply doughnut principles, powering themselves with renewables and redesigning urban systems for circularity. This isn’t theory—it’s happening. Yet the scale is still modest relative to global need.</li>
      <li><strong>Reframing ambition:</strong> The strength of this paradigm shift lies in raising our ambition—from “green growth” or “inclusive growth” to regenerative and distributive design. It invites policymakers, entrepreneurs, and citizens to think bigger and differently.</li>
      <li><strong>A caveat:</strong> While the model is elegant, translating the doughnut into actionable policy and economic systems faces resistance—from entrenched interests, powerful institutions, and societies culturally aligned to consumption and competition.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Overall, Raworth’s talk is a call to reimagine what progress means in the 21st century.
      It asks us not to stop growing prematurely, but to recognize that economies—like people or trees—
      grow best when they mature into sustainable, inclusive systems that enable human and planetary flourishing.

  <h3>The Danger of a Single Story</h3>

  </a>

  <p class="preview">
    Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s TED Talk, “The Danger of a Single Story,” highlights how reducing cultures, peoples, or places to a singular narrative can foster misunderstanding and prejudice.
  </p>
  <button class="toggle-btn" type="button" aria-expanded="false">My take on this ▾</button>
  <div class="collapsible" hidden>
    <p>
      She opens by describing her childhood love of Western literature and how, unconsciously, she absorbed a one-sided view of life. Reflecting on her own writing, she realized that she portrayed characters in her stories with foreign characteristics—never like herself or her family.
    </p>
    <p>
      She also shares personal anecdotes: her American roommate who assumed she’d never read, her experiences in
      Mexico met with suspicion because of nationality, and how the West stereotyped Africa as a continent of poverty
      or desperation. Adichie stresses that single stories rob people of dignity, flatten complexity, and fuel
      narrow-mindedness. She urges embracing multiple stories to form a richer, more nuanced worldview.
    </p>

    <h4>What are my reflections:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Power and Peril of Narrative:</strong> Adichie’s central insight—that stories define how we understand others—is profound. When we hear only one version, we risk crystallizing a stereotype. In a globalized world brimming with media narratives, being mindful of which stories we consume becomes vital.</li>
      <li><strong>Identity & Representation:</strong> Reflections on representation—writing characters who never looked like her or shared her experience—touch on broader issues within literature and media. It reminds us that who gets to tell stories matters deeply; marginalized perspectives remain underrepresented.</li>
      <li><strong>Empathy Through Balance:</strong> The antidote to the single story is balance. Hearing multiple, even contradictory narratives about a place or person invites empathy. It helps us recognize people as full, evolving individuals—not static caricatures.</li>
      <li><strong>Practical Implications:</strong> Consider education, journalism, or social media today: an echo chamber of stories can shape public opinion, policy, or cultural perception. Asking “whose story is missing?” becomes a powerful question—especially when assessing news coverage or history curricula.</li>
      <li><strong>Personal Growth:</strong> On an individual level, reflecting on your own internal “single stories” can provoke meaningful self-awareness. We may assume things about our coworkers, neighbors, or distant cultures without truly knowing. Interrogating those assumptions can lead to richer relationships and greater cultural humility.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>Concluding comment:</strong> Adichie’s message is timeless and relevant even today after more than a decade.
      It reminds us that storytelling is both a responsibility and a gift. By listening to multiple stories, we build empathy,
      critical awareness, and the ability to honor complexity and human dignity—whether in business, culture, or any role in society.
