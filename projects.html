          <h3 class="title">COP Buddy – Intergenerational Project</h3>
          <p class="desc">
            When I first started working on the COP Buddy Project in Auckland, I saw how urbanization and nuclear families had created a visible distance between younger and older generations. I wanted to rebuild those bonds. Through COP Buddy, I brought together senior citizens and young adults in juvenile correction centers, creating a safe space for conversations, storytelling, and shared activities.

            This was never meant to be a quick fix — it was about restoring compassion and intergenerational wisdom that once shaped our communities. Watching both groups connect, laugh, and learn from one another was one of the most rewarding experiences of my career. The pilot was a success, and I believe this model can be replicated and scaled to strengthen social fabrics across many communities.

          <h3 class="title">Apple Production Improvement, Himachal Pradesh</h3>
          <p class="desc">
            Growing up in India, agriculture was always close to my heart. In Himachal Pradesh, I had the chance to work on a project that combined government leadership with international expertise, supported by the World Bank and ADB. My role was to help facilitate knowledge-sharing partnerships that would improve apple yields and modernize the production process.

            The impact was clear: better productivity, improved livelihoods, and more jobs for farming communities. What excites me most is that this model doesn’t just stop at apples in Himachal Pradesh. It is scalable across crops and regions, and it shows how thoughtful partnerships can transform local economies while staying sustainable.

          <h3 class="title">Feasibility Studies Portfolio</h3>
          <p class="desc">
            Along the way, I’ve also carried out several feasibility studies across Education, Agriculture, Urban Planning, Smart Cities, and Climate Change. Each study gave me the opportunity to work with institutions and corporations across borders, helping them chart pathways toward sustainable development.

            These studies may not always make headlines, but they have real impact. They guide decisions, unlock funding, and give communities a practical roadmap for growth. For me, they reflect the same values that drive all my work: equity, shared prosperity, and sustainability.
